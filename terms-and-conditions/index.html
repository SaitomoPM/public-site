							such, we cannot remove a file from the servers; however, if we receive a DMCA notice from you, we will
							work to have the data identifier to such content removed so that the content is not searchable or accessible via
							gateways that are operated by us (we have no control over third-party gateways using our open source

							Service or your use of the Service, or any products or services offered or distributed through the Service
							(“Disputes”) is eligible for it, you agree that any disputes shall be heard solely within the New York
							Small Claims Court (“Small Claims Court”). If a dispute claims multiple claims and one or more of those

							of this Section 26 shall constitute your and AR.IO’s written agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the
							Federal Arbitration Act. Any modification to this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by you and
							AR.IO. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association and conducted before a

							<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">You agree that you may bring claims against us only in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or

								action. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions.</p>

							<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, either party may bring suit in court of

							<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
							processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (i) if you want us to establish the data's
							accuracy; (ii) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you
							need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend
							legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have
							overriding legitimate grounds to use it. This would be a pointless request for you because we do not
								collect any personal data from you.</p>

							<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third
							party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. This
							would be a pointless request for you because we do not collect any personal data from you.</p>

							<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this
							will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you

								case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>

							<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">No fee usually required so that you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
							exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly
							unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these
								circumstances.</p>

							<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">Time limit to respond to your legitimate requests will be one (1) month. Occasionally it may take us

						<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">
							We permit residents of California to use our Service. Therefore, it is our intent to comply with the
							California Business and Professions Code §§ 22575-22579. If you are a California resident you may request
							certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to any third parties for their direct
							marketing purposes. Various provisions throughout this Agreement address requirements of the Californian
							privacy statutes. In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors.
							You may contact us at email: "legal (at) ar (dot) io" with any questions.

						<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">
							We share your personal data within the company group. If you are located in the European Union, this will
							involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) because we are a US-based company.
							We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our group companies to follow the same rules
							when processing your personal data. These rules are called "binding corporate rules". Some of our external
							third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data
							will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>

							<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is
								afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>

							<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level
								of protection for personal data by the European Commission.</p>

							<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission
								which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</p>

							<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy
							Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and
								the US.</p>

							<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">Please contact our DPM (see Section 35) if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by
							us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

						<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;" class="text-gray paragraph-text">
							We may amend this Agreement from time to time. When we amend this Agreement, we will post the normal changes
							here. Your continued use of our Service shall constitute your acceptance of such changes. Historic
							versions can be obtained by contacting our DPM (see Section 35).
